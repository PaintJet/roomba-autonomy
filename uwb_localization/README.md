# uwb_localization
This package only contains a launch file that launches the `tag_publisher` node from the `DWM1001-Interface` package. It also instantiates `static_transform_publishers` to publish the transforms from the `base_link` to UWB modules. For more documentation on the `tag_publisher`, check the `DWM1001-Interface` package.
